Args:
{Text Name} -> "str": The raw text for analysis.
{Tokenizer} -> "str": The tokenizer to use (e.g., "word", "sentence").
{Stemmer} -> "str": The stemmer to use (e.g., "porter", "lancaster").
{Stopwords Language} -> "str": The language of stopwords (e.g., "english").
{Tagger} -> "str": The part-of-speech tagger to use.
{Chunker} -> "str": The chunker or named entity recognizer to use.
{Frequency Count} -> "int": The number of most common words/phrases to display, range between 5-15
{Plot Title} -> "str": Title for plots.

Step 1. Import required python packages.
```python

```
Step 2. Load the text and name it as {Text Name}
```python

```
Step 3. Tokenize the text based on {Tokenizer}.
```python

```
Step 4. Remove punctuation from the list of tokens
```python

```
Step 5. Remove stop words from the text using {Stopwords Language}
```python

```
Step 6. Convert all tokens to lowercase
```python

```
Step 7. Perform lemmatization to the list of tokens
```python

```
Step 8. Implement part-of-speech tagging for the above sentence using {Tagger}
```python

```
Step 9. Implement stemming for sentences after word segmentation using {Stemmer}
```python

```
Step 10. Extract named entities or perform chunking based on {Chunker}
```python

```
Step 11. Calculate frequency distribution of tokens.
```python

```
Step 12. Display the {Frequency Count} most common tokens.
```python

```
Step 13. Visualize the frequency distribution using a bar chart with {Plot Title}.
```python

```

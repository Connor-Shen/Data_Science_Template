"""

Step 1. Import required python packages.
```python

```

Step 2. Load the dataset from the URL{Dataset URL} into a pandas DataFrame named {DataFrame Name}
.
```python

```

Step 3. Calculate and display the number of missing values in each column of the DataFrame {DataFrame Name}.
```python

```

Step 4. Replace missing values in the {Selected column name} column with the median value of the same column. Make sure to apply this change to the DataFrame {DataFrame Name} itself.
```python

```
 
Step 5. Remove any remaining rows with missing values from the DataFrame {DataFrame Name}. Ensure that changes are made inplace.
```python

```

Step 6. Perform {Data transformation} to {Selected column name} and give the data distribution of the column
```python

```

Step 7. Detect whether there are outliers in {Selected column name}, values that exceed {Outlier degree} the standard deviation of the mean are defined as outliers.
```python

```

Step 8. Visualize Outliers Using Box Plots for {Selected column name}, using {Plot Title}, {X-axis Label}, {Y-axis Label}, {Figure size}, {Color}.
```python

```

Step 9. Convert values in the {Selected column name} column to numerical values using label encoding.
```python

```

Step 10. Group and Aggregate Data by {Selected feature name} and calculate the min， max， average of each group.
```python

```

Step 11. Display the correlation matrix of three related {Selected column name}.
```python

```

Step 12. Plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix calculated in Step 11. Display the heatmap with annotations for each cell.
```python

```
